# INTEX Application

As part of the Junior Core coursework in the Information Systems program at BYU, I partnered with 3 other Information Systems students to develop a web application for the Ancient Religious Studies Department at BYU.

This project was built in C# using ASP.NET Core to provide BYU researches a central repository to record data regarding ancient burial sites in Egypt. We developed this application by performing ETL techiques on raw, unstructured data; populating and designing AWS RDS database; deveoping a full-stack ASP.NET web application; and adding various security and control measures
